This Folder contains the code written for understanding Javascript's IIFE (Immediately Invoked function Expression)
mechanism to make sure no local variables bleed into the global scope.
In this, I learned following concepts of angularjs 1.5.8 


1. AngularJs just exposes one global scoped object named, angular

2. $scope object is for sharing data between view and viewmodel

3. How 2 way data binding works in Angular 1.5
